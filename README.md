# Cryptonaut

Small page that calculates the price per coin from one crypto currency when it reaches the market cap of another.

## Install

Run `yarn install` and `yarn build` to build the app in the `dist/` folder. The data from coinmarketcap.com is used but it's cached (10 mins) on api.sourcebox.be because of the request limits and the sometimes slow response times.

The url api.sourcebox.be is temporary, so you shouldn't use it for anything.

## Notes

Code is a mess right now.
